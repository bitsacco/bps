# Bitsacco PFI compete

This is a proof of concept for selection patterns between several mock PFIs offering similar onramp/offramp swaps for Bitsacco. At Bitsacco, we are presently interested on BTC/KES liquidity pairings. Having multiple PFI servers might be a good way to scale for liquidity and to build for redundancy and resilience in swap channels.
